# Overview

Our data was provided by Cyrille Rathberger. In this report, we are studying data from 2007 Abreschviller, Donon, Vosges Mountains, France. We are extracting information from two datasets: 

- Cell count data for 15 trees sampled weekly during growth season.
- Meteorological data sampled every day of the year.

*Our goal is to investigate the interactions between meteorological data that give rise to high/low cell count observations.*

Our first step is to perform topological data analysis (TDA). This method enables to determine the *shape* of the data, hence helping to deduce its structure. It is particularly useful in exploratory data analysis on complex datasets were many of the variables are correlated with each other. It helps to determine essential, large-scale features in the data. An important attribute of this technique is its robustness to noise, which is advantageous when dealing with biological data.

# The data

## Cell count data
```{r load_cc, echo = FALSE}
load("/Users/lancelotdacosta/Desktop/Data/Cell Count Data/Cellcounts_ABR_2007to2009.RData")

##Extract year 2007
ABR_07 <- filter(ABR.raw.data, Year == 2007)
```

```{r head_cc}
#Cell count data for Abreshviller 2007
head(ABR_07)
```

```{r head_cc_comment}
#DY: Day of the year
#RF: Radial file
#CZ: n° of Cambial cells
#EZ: n° of Enlarging cells
#WZ: n° of Wall-thickening cells
#MZ: n° of Mature cells
#PR: Precision of sampling
```

Each tree was sampled 31 times during the year 2007 (missing data is indicated as NA). For each sample there are three measurements (RF), corresponding to three radial files. Each of the three radial files comprises of the count of Cambial Cells (CZ), enlarging cells (EZ), Wall-thickening cells (WZ) and mature cells (MZ).

## Meteorological data

```{r load_meteo, echo = FALSE}
meteo_ABR <- read.delim("/Users/lancelotdacosta/Desktop/Data/Meteorological data/DonneesMeteoJournalieres_Abreschviller_AE.txt")

#extract year 2007
meteo_ABR_07 <- filter(meteo_ABR, annee == 2007)
```

```{r head_meteo}
#Meteorological data for Abreshviller 2007
head(meteo_ABR_07)
```

```{r head_meteo_comment}
#annee: Year
#jour: Day of the year

# The Mapper algorithm

The TDA algorithm we use is called Mapper. This algorithm among other things inputs a data frame of numerical values and outputs a graph. The vertices in the graph correspond to clusters and edges link vertices when the corresponding clusters share points.

In the example below, we sample a dataset from an ellipse. The figure below shows the data on the left, and the Mapper algorithm's output on the right. On the left we plot the data, on the right we plot the output of the Mapper algorithm. Of course, if our data frame contains two variables like in this case, the algorithm is not useful, but when it contains more variables (e.g. multiple environmental factors) this method can be very informative.

```{r ellipse}
ellipse = data.frame(x = cos(1:50), y= 5*sin(1:50))
```

```{r mapper_ellipse, echo = FALSE}
#ggplot object of ellipse
p_ellipse <- ellipse %>% ggplot(aes(x,y))
p_ellipse <- p_ellipse + geom_point() + ggtitle("Ellipse") + coord_fixed(ratio = 0.3)

#do mapper
m <- mapper1D(dist(ellipse), ellipse$x)
g <- graph.adjacency(m$adjacency, mode="undirected")

# start new page
plot.new() 

# setup layout
gl <- grid.layout(nrow=1, ncol=2)

# setup viewports
vp.1 <- viewport(layout.pos.col=1, layout.pos.row=1) 
vp.2 <- viewport(layout.pos.col=2, layout.pos.row=1) 

# init layout
pushViewport(viewport(layout=gl))

# access the first position
pushViewport(vp.1)

# start new base graphics in first viewport
par(new=TRUE, fig=gridFIG())

#print
print(p_ellipse, newpage = FALSE)

# done with the first viewport
popViewport()

# move to the next viewport
pushViewport(vp.2)

par(new=TRUE, fig=gridFIG())

plot(g, layout = layout.auto(g))
mtext("Mapper output")

# done with this viewport
popViewport(1)
```

It is difficult to explain the algorithm without using pictures nor math. An excellent explanation is given in 0:00-15:00 of [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDe72aINF2s). A more mathematical and in-depth explanation is in 0:00-20:00 of [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Z73Wd2T1xE&t=936s).

To run Mapper, we need to specify a way to visualise the data as input, which we call a *lens* or *filter function*. In practice a lens is a one or two number summary of each observation in the data (i.e. a lens is one or two real-valued functions defined on rows of the dataset). It is most useful to use a lens that summarises important features in the data. However, in exploratory data analysis we usually do not know what these may be. This is why it is important to run the algorithm many times with different lenses. These will enable to build incremental knowledge about the data even with poorly chosen lenses. 

#Methodology

Mapper gives information about the “shape” of data in a data frame. Since our meteorological data and cell count data are in two separate data frames, we must merge them into one to be able to apply Mapper.

We observe the following:

- Cell count data is sampled weekly throughout the growing season while meteorological data is sampled daily throughout the year.
- To be able to merge the two data frames, we need both data sets to be sampled at the same times.
- Ultimately, we would like to account for all the variability in the meteorological data in its influence on cell count data. Therefore, it would be counterproductive to reduce meteorological data to weekly samples during the growing season. Rather, it would be ideal to know the daily cell count data.

*Our attempt is to approximate daily cell count data by linear interpolation on the available data.*

We bear in mind the following:

- Linear interpolation of cell count data between weeks is a naive approximation that does not take meteorology into account. We intend to incorporate more sophisticated methods of interpolation, taking meteorology and biological factors into account, later in the project if first results indicate that this is necessary.
- We think that Mapper, which gives insights about large scale features in the data while being robust to noise, will be largely insensitive to the type of interpolation that we use.
- We approximate cell count data outside of the growing season by the values of the first or last sample. That is, we assume that there is no growth in trees outside of the sampling range. 


## Data Cleaning

In the process of implementation we have encountered missing values in the cell count data. Mapper cannot deal with NAs so it is important to replace them by numerical values.

We have replaced the missing values using the following two-step algorithm, applied to every tree separately :

Given a cell type XZ (CZ, EZ, TZ, MZ) in a sample S,

1) If one or two cell values are NA, replace XZ NAs by the mean of the non-NA XZ values.

2) If all values are NA, replace XZ NAs by linear interpolation on the previous and next available sample.

Finally, we obtained a 16425 observation data frame with daily meteorology and daily cell count data for all 15 trees.


```{r head_df, echo= FALSE}

load("CMP project/large_matrix_ABR07.RData")

df[9760:9771,]
```

The above dataframe shows the result of the linear interpolation and replacement algorithm, the precision and sample values are zero at these 'artificially generated' observations. This is because the cell count data at day 217 and 218 has been linearly interpolated from the information in the original data set. We did not interpolate the sample number (Sample) nor the sample precision (PR) because it does not make sense. We remove these two variables and the non-numerical variables (Site, Species) before applying Mapper.

# Results

Thanks to linear interpolation we have an estimate cell-count data for every tree throughout the year. Below, the resulting cellular dynamics of tree 42 are plotted:

```{r plotree, echo = FALSE}
ggtree(42)
```

Our Mapper analyses are giving us interesting shapes. Here is one of them:

```{r results, echo = FALSE}
#{r label, out.width = "85%", fig.cap = "caption"}
include_graphics("/Users/lancelotdacosta/Desktop/ABR07/R markdown/Mapper_ABR07_(2).pdf")
```

The lens we used in this case was a two number summary for each observation given by *(vent + pluie + hum + tsec, MZ)*.

# Current and future research

Currently are working on the following:

- The Mapper graph from above is generated by taking into account meteorological data on the day a given number of mature cells is observed. However, growth is the product of environmental influences over a time before the cell can be observed. We therefore test the influence of rolling means of meteorological data over a varying number of days *d*.
- Due to the exploratory nature of this data analysis we do not know what lense is the most sensible to apply to this kind of dataset. We therefore run Mapper with many different lenses to get more intuition about the shape of our datasets. This will guide further analyses.
- The distinct shapes observed in the Mapper graphs are (besides the choice of lense), the result of the multidimensional input data. A given node can be backtraced to a subset of data. We therefore need to understand which observations in the data correspond to which node in each output of Mapper.


In the near future we hope to:

- Check whether lenses with biological meaning would make sense: In particular we would like to determine over how many days a mean should be generated, whether minimum and maximum temperatures should be considered and year-specific impacts on tree growth such as frost events. 
- Run Mapper with a lens that uses PCA.
- Use a better interpolation technique to estimate daily cell count data, ideally which takes meteorology into account.
- Test whether species/sites display the same shapes given the same lense.
- Test whether certain shapes in our Mapper outputs can be associated with of a lot or little growth.
- Incorporate another variable with *Quality Check* values that indicate where NAs have been replaced.


# Problems

```{r q1, echo = FALSE, fig.height= 1, fig.width = 1}
include_graphics("/Users/lancelotdacosta/Desktop/ABR07/R markdown/Tree52rmd.png")
```

1) For many of the trees, and indeed tree 52, extrapolating the number of mature cells at the end of the year from the last observed sample produces values that are much lower than the maximum, which is biologically non-meaningful. Which other type of interpolation at the end of the year should we use?

```{r q2, echo = FALSE}
include_graphics("/Users/lancelotdacosta/Desktop/ABR07/R markdown/Tree43rmd.png")
```

2) Some of the trees grew after the last sample. For instance, in tree 43 there are about 15 wall-thickening cells in the last sample. We need to correct this by artificially making the number of WZ (and EZ in some other cases) gradually go down to 0 at the end of the growing season (and gradually increase MZ in the same period). Which period of time should we use as approximation? Like linear interpolation, this is obviously actually dependent on environmental factors.

3) We are not taking into account the precision factor PR in the original data as do not know how to replace the missing values or how to interpolate it. Any ideas on how we could do so?
